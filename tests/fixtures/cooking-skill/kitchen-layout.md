# Kitchen Layout

## Silverware and Utensils

- I store my silverware in a divided drawer near the sink for easy access when washing dishes.
- Cooking utensils like spatulas, ladles, and tongs are kept in a utensil

## Pots and Pans

- Pots and pans are stored in lower cabinets near the stove for quick access while cooking.
- I use a hanging rack above the stove for frequently used pans.

## Ingredients and Spices

- Dry ingredients like flour, sugar, and pasta are stored in airtight containers on open shelves.
